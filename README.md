# Topic-Stack in Data Structure
## Author: Neeraj Shankar = codewithneeraj@outlook.com

## About the STACK:
A stack is a linear data structure. Any operation on the stack is performed in LIFO (Last In First Out) order. This means the element to enter the container last would be the first one to leave the container. It is imperative that elements above an element in a stack must be removed first before fetching any element.

Elements in a stack can only be pushed to a limit. And this extra pushing of elements in a stack leads to stack overflow.

### Applications of Stack:
1. Function Call: A function until it returns reserves a space in the memory stack. Any function embedded in some function comes above the parent function in the stack. 
2. Infix to postfix conversion (and other similar conversions) will be dealt with in the coming tutorials.
3. Parenthesis matching and many more...

## About this Branch:
This branch contains java programs demonstrating various types of operations performed on stack like push, pop, peek, postfix, infix, etc.
and stack application
## Running The code 
  ### Prerequisite
    Make sure the java 8 or greater is installed on the system

  ### How to run using cmd or terminal

    To compile the program - javac filename.java
    To run the program - java filename.class
  #### Recommended to use IDE like IntelliJ Idea or VS code

### List of programs:
#### 1. UnderstandingTheStack - gives and basic insight on stack
#### 2. Implementing_Stack_Using_Array - demonstrate various stack operations like push, pop, peek, etc 
#### 3. ParenthesisMatching - Checks if the given set of brackets in an expression is balanced or not.
